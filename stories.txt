* runaway optimizations
i look at the sun and my eyes hurt and squint unwillingly. Any time I look anywhere I'm absorbing light.  The act of seeing is the act of seeking light, yearning for it to inter our retinas, lanuching a nural cascade through the berain all the way to the cartesian theatre chambre in the supervenient alcove somewhere above the amygdala.What if seeking light were the same kind of a runaway optinization that is told in the story of blue-maximizing robot that covers its oculars woth a beach towel so that everything is one unyielding bluenesss.

 Everything is light for the seeker of light. Munchkin the evolution, outwit the unuverse. Azatoth sets the rules he cannot enforce.



a hymn to azatoth is a markov chain of lifes and deaths, senses lost and regained, extasies and fears unbound.
