* problem
: rejiggle wave files algorithmically and make music.

** idea 
:cut a long recording into pieces, reckon some abstrac data from these pieces, and arrange them according to that data.

*** implementation: take
 some measure of a wavelet (avg amp, median amp, fft'd dominant frequency, )


list of pairs (compositional metatdata, wave data), take permutations.

* lispy outline


(defn mutate (sqq)
 (permutation sqq))

(mutate sqq)
(play seq)

* how to qxtract compositional features:
 -  shapes in both amp and freq domains. geenrate simple shapes and comb with a kernel.
 - reduce dimensionality and classify with e.g pfd of logistic regression.
 - freq pattrns that correspond to recognizable timbres
 - count clicks: an amplitudinal feature


* generate
 - sequences of clecks and beeps
 - permutaions of sequences of short sound bytes
 - timbral compositions
 - rhythmic and polyrhythmic structures
 -
